You remember the TV game show, where contestants were eliminated by their team because they were the lowest performers - the weakest link? I was reminded of this recently as I pondered [Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt's theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints).
## The Theory of Constraints

One of the main tenets of Lean Manufacturing, the theory of constraints basically says "Every process has a constraint (bottleneck) and focusing improvement efforts on that constraint is the fastest and most effective path to improved profitability." (see http://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints.html) In other words, every complex system consists of multiple linked activities, one of which acts as a constraint upon the **entire system**. The productivity of the entire system is constrained by this single activity.
