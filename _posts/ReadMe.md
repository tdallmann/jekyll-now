# Post Ideas
  * Complete transparency - making sure the rest of the organization knows what you're doing, why you're doing it, and the results of what you've done.
  * The role of QA in an organization
    * NOT manual testers (QA ia about QAULITY, not TESTING)
    * Why 95% of all tests should be API driven
  * Transitioning from Testers to automated test developers
  * Time tracking
  * Why software can't be estimated
  * "Static environments get dirty"
  * zero-downtime deployments (why they're so important to CD, how to manage database or other dependency, stages: full operation, read-only, down)
  * Bottom up, Top-down, or Middle-out - challenges no matter where you start
